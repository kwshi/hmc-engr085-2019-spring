\item Please indicate how many hours you spent on this lab.  This will
  be helpful for calibrating the workload for next time the course is
  taught.

\item State transition diagrams for the room and sword FSMs.

  \begin{solution}

  \end{solution}

\item Behavioral SystemVerilog code for the system.

  \begin{solution}

  \end{solution}

\item A single testbench and test vectors illustrating both the win
  and die cases.

  \begin{solution}

  \end{solution}

\item Simulation waveforms including the inputs, outputs, and current
  room.  Do they pass your testbench and match expectations?

  \begin{solution}

  \end{solution}

\item RTL Viewer schematics (including each FSM).  Do they match your
  expectation?

  \begin{solution}

  \end{solution}

\item EXTRA CREDIT: It is a little known fact that the Twisty Tunnel
  is located beneath Hoch and that by heading north one can reach the
  dormitories.  Extend your adventure game with more interesting rooms
  or objects.  There will be a prize for the most interesting working
  enhancement!
